# TrustyAI LM-Eval Tasks

This repo contains tasks for EleutherAI's [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main)
built by the TrustyAI team. These tasks may be PoCs that are not yet ready to contribute upstream, or may simply be too
TrustyAI-specific to warrant contribution to the main lm-eval repo.

# Installation
Copy the `tasks` directory from this repo into the [lm_eval/tasks](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks) directory,
then build the Python module.
